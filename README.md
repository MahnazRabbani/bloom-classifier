# Bloom Classifier: Deep Learning-Based Flower Species Recognition

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing and implementing a machine learning model to accurately classify different species of flowers based on images. The application of this project can be found in various fields, such as botany, smart agriculture, landscaping design, and biodiversity conservation efforts.

## Dataset   

102 Category Flower Dataset: 8189 examples consists of 102 categories, [link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MahnazRabbani/bloom-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bloom-classifier`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the data setup script (this downloads and preprocesses the data): `python src/data_processing.py`

## Running the Project
1. Train the model: `python src/model.py`
2. Evaluate the model: `python src/evaluate.py`
